##springTest

#How to run the program:
The following is the instructions of how to get the program running. It was built using Intellij Ultimate using SQLITE Studio, so i recommend using these to get the same results as when it was created.
Open up the program and build the code.
Navigate to "StringtestApplication" and run the program.
If successful Spring should start up in the console and start listing off all the Spring Boot beans when ready.
The program is now ready to be interacted with and can be accessed at: http://localhost:8080/ ( I would recomend using postman to interact with the program but can also be done through any browser using the REST URL style )

#Postman
To access the program I would recomend postman, the postman templates and commands can be found in the root of this git repo. Please feel free to play arround with the commands and DB access

#Functionality
The program is not fully finished but it is nearly complete within the timeframe. If i had more time i would have completed the task to the specification, but unfortunately I have not been able to and I appologise for this. 
But i have been able demonstrate my understanding of Java, Spring, DBAccess, SQL, Postman, Git * Gradle.

#Extensions
If I had more time I would focus on completion of the main task but I would also:
Integrate Swagger for the project so that in can be viewed and understood clearer without the need for postman.
Exporting the completed schedules to an .XLS document so if can be saved and sent externally.
Normalizating the database to future proof and keep it nice and clean.
Refactoring the code to reduce the number of times the DB is accessed per function call.
